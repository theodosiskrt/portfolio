  "I am a self-taught software developer from Greece. I started my journey in 2020 learning the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript as well as some back-end logic. I decided to move on to front-end development in the summer of 2021 when I started studying a very reputable front-end library called React.js. That's how I got my very first front-end development position and this helped me improve as a developer. I have gained a lot of new knowledge, not just in Javascript but in many other tools, such as Git and even Figma!";
